These algorithms can be as advanced or as simple as you would like, even just an "Hello, World!" algorithm:

```Java
// LANGUAGE: Java
// AUTHOR: SÃ¸ren Eriksen
// GITHUB: https://github.com/soer7022

class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
